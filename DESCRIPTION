Description: STooDs is a framework to build and estimate probabilistic models
    for data varying in Space, Time or other Dimensions. This R package is 
    built as an R User Interface (RUI) to the computational STooDs engine, 
    which is a FORTRAN executable piloted by text configuration files.
    The RUI defines classes (objects' properties and methods) for the various
    building blocks of STooDs inference. Its typical usage is as follows:
    (1) define the probabilistic model and its constitutive objects (dataset,
    parameters, dimensions, processes); (2) perform Bayesian-MCMC inference;
    (3) read, analyse and use MCMC samples.
